An Infinite Runner Gamer uisng Unity and C#.
Hello Everyone,
I have made an Infinite Runner game in Unity & C#. This game is very similar to google dinosaur game. Please do try out on your laptops and PC's and give feedbacks and comments on whatever you felt. You can also comment in comment section below if you have itch.io account. Game has uploaded at resolution of 1600*900 i.e. 16:9 aspect ratio so adjust the screen accordingly. Use up arrow and down arrow key to control the player. Forgive me if the colliders are too aggressive to detect touches.
